### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Search/filter for a robot by the robotId.
- Sort through all attributes by ascending or descinding order.
- Display a list of all robots upon render.

### Built with

- React.Js
- Bootstrap
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript

### Bonus

If I had more time, I would like to continue styling the application.

I would like to implement a progress bar for the battery level. My list is also really long, therefore, I would like to implement some kind of pagination. I would prefer to have it show the first 10 robots and give the user the ability to click on an arrow or a specific page number where they can see another list of 10 robots.
